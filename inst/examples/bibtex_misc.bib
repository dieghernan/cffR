	abstract     = {We have implemented and evaluated IYOUIT, a context-aware application for the mobile phone that promotes a digital lifestyle, sharing, and life-logging approach for people on the go. The service incorporates context management technology to abstract data about and around the user into meaningful interpretations of the user's digital trace in the real world. Complementary to the public release of our service, we have conducted a longitudinal field study with 19 users for a period of one month. In this paper, we present findings from this coordinated user trial and provide researchers with advice on the design and implementation of similar systems.},
