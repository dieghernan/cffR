#' Install a
#' [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#_committing_workflow_hooks)
#' that remembers you to update your `CITATION.cff` file.

#'
#' @details
#'
#' This function would install a pre-commit hook using
#' [usethis::use_git_hook()].
#'
#' A pre-commit hook is a script that identifies  simple issues before
#' submission to code review. This pre-commit hook would warn you if any of the
#' following conditions are met:
#' - You included in a commit your DESCRIPTION or inst/CITATION file, you
#'   are not including your `CITATION.cff` and the `CITATION.cff` file is
#'   "older" than any of your DESCRIPTION or inst/CITATION file, or
#' - You have updated your `CITATION.cff` but you are not including it on
#'   your commit.
#'
#' # A word of caution
#'
#' The pre-commit hook may prevent you to commit if you are not updating your
#' `CITATION.cff`. However, the mechanism of detection is not perfect and would
#' be triggered also even if you have tried to update your `CITATION.cff` file.
#'
#' This is typically the case when you have updated your DESCRIPTION or
#' inst/CITATION files but those changes doesn't make a change on your
#' `CITATION.cff` file (i.e. you are including new dependencies).
#'
#' In those cases, you can override the check running `git commit --no-verify`
#' on the Terminal tab. If you are using
#' [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts),
#' you can run also this command from a R script by selecting that line and
#' sending it to the Terminal using:
#'
#' - `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` (Windows & Linux), or
#' - `Cmd+Option+Return` (Mac).
#'
#' # Removing the git pre-commit hook
#'
#' You can remove the pre-commit hook by running `cff_git_hook_remove()`.
