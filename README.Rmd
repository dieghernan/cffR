[Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
[@Druskat_Citation_File_Format_2021] are plain text files with human- and
machine-readable citation information for software (and datasets). Code
developers can include them in their repositories to let others know how to
correctly cite their software.

**cffr** provides utilities to generate, parse, modify and validate
`CITATION.cff` files automatically for R packages, as well as tools and examples
for working with .cff more generally.

When you put a `CITATION.cff` file in the default branch of your GitHub
repository, it is automatically linked from the repository landing page, and the
citation information is rendered on the repository page, and also provided as
BibTeX snippet which users can simply copy

## Installation

You can install the developing version of **cff** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dieghernan/cffr")
```

Alternatively, you can install **cffr** using the
[r-universe](https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev/ui#builds):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Enable this universe
options(repos = c(
  dieghernan = "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
install.packages("cffr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a `cffr` object:

```{r }
library(cffr)

# Example with an installed package
test <- cff_create("ggplot2")
```

<details><summary>
<strong>cffr object</strong></summary>


```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}

test
```

</details>

We can validate the result using `cff_validate()`:

```{r }

cff_validate(test)
```

By default most often from within your package folder you'll simply run
`cffr::cff_write()`, that creates a `cffr` object, write it on a `CITATION.cff`
file and validates it on a single command.

Check the [docs](https://dieghernan.github.io/cffr/reference/index.html) to
learn how to work with `cffr` objects.

## Citation

To cite the **cffr** package in publications use:

```{r}
citation("cffr")
```

You can also use the [citation provided by GitHub](https://github.com/dieghernan/cffr), 
that is generated from the information of a 
`CITATION.cff` created with **cffr**. See 
[About CITATION files](https://docs.github.com/es/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-citation-files)
for more info.
